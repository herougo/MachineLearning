# Machine Learning

This is a collection of machine learning examples and resuable wrappers.

## Reusable Wrappers

Value History Plotter: https://github.com/herougo/MachineLearning/blob/master/python/helpers/done/ValueHistoryClass.py
- a class which logs values and plots them when you are done

Matplotlib Wrapper: https://github.com/herougo/MachineLearning/blob/master/python/helpers/done/PlottingWrapper.py
- a wrapper around Matplotlib to make plots with single lines of code.

Testing Multiple Sklearn Models: https://github.com/herougo/MachineLearning/blob/master/python/examples/done/MultipleModelsExample.py
- a dictionary of different Sklearn models so that they can be easily iterated and tried on a single data set.

## Examples

Sentdex Tensorflow Examples: https://github.com/herougo/MachineLearning/tree/master/python/examples/done/TensorflowTest
- Tensorflow Examples using convolutional NNs and recurrent NNs I went through in Sentdex's Youtube videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYbVFhK_olY&list=PLSPWNkAMSvv5DKeSVDbEbUKSsK4Z-GgiP.
